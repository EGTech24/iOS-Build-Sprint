Hello, and welcome to __Converency__- an easy to use app for getting up-to-date exchange rates. Not only for foreign currencies, but cryptocurrencies as well.

# Usability

With its clean aesthetic, it's an __absolute breeze__ to use Converency. You just type in the amount and select the currency you would like it converted to. The price label automatically changes so there's no need to constantly press a convert button. Switching between foreign currency and cryptocurrency is easy as well, just tap on either of the icons located at the bottom.

# Future Goals
Give users the ability to convert from multiple foreign currencies. As of today (02/07/2020), you can only convert from USD.
